The baghchal package has 3 sub-modules:

- **baghchal.env** (Consists of all classes and functions defining the game environment):
    - **baghchal.env.Board** (Board class representing Bagh Chal board)
    - **baghchal.env.Bagh** (Bagh class representing Bagh Player)
    - **baghchal.env.Goat** (Goat class representing Goat Player)
- **baghchal.lookup_table** (Lookup values for baghchal.env)
- **baghchal.engine** (Class for the Bagh Chal engines)
